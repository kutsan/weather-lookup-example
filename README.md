# `weather-me` [![Node CI](https://github.com/kutsan/weather-me/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kutsan/weather-me/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Node+CI%22)

Simple weather application that uses OpenWeatherMap API. I needed a fast app to
simply search for cities and show their current weather conditions. So, it does
simply one thing, show the current weather and its details.
